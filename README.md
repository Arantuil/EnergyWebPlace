TubbyTurtlesPlace/EnergyWebPlace is a web3 version of r/place, deployed on the Energy Web chain. You can buy pixels, and if you own the pixel you can change it to any color you want.
After you've bought a pixel, any other user can buy the pixel/pixels from you at any time.

Each pixel only costs 0.0025 EWT (Less then $0.01). An owned pixel can be bought by other users. You can buy a single pixel by just clicking on one, or you can use multi-select option below.
